    <p class="margin">Machine learning is a branch of AI which focuses on
        the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its
        accuracy. Machine learning algorithms are trained to find relationships and patterns in data. They use historical data as
        input to make predictions, classify information and cluster data points.</p>
