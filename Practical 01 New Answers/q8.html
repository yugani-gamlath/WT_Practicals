        <h2>Key Features of React</h2>
        <ul align="left" type="circle">
            <li>Component-Based: React organizes the UI into <i>reusable components</i>, making it easy to manage and maintain.</li>
            <li>Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to improve performance by minimizing actual DOM manipulations.</li>
            <li>Declarative Syntax: React allows you to describe the UI's desired state, and it takes care of updating the DOM to match that state.</li>
            <li>Open Source: React is open-source, with a large and active community, making it well-supported and extendable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started with React</h2>
        <p>To start using React, you typically set up a development environment, which includes <del>Node.js</del> and <ins>npm (Node Package Manager)</ins>. You can then create <mark>React applications using tools like Create React App</mark> or by setting up a custom project.</p>
        <p>Once your environment is ready, you can define React components, render them, and create dynamic user interfaces.</p>
