    <h1><font face="Calibri" color="green">Sri Lanka</font></h1>
    <h2><i>Introduction of Sri Lanka</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Sri Lanka is an island country located off the southern coast of India. Sri Lanka is surrounded by the Indian
        Ocean, Gulf of Mannar, the Palk Strait, and lies in the <strike>vicinity of India and the Maldives</strike>. The geography of Sri
        Lanka includes coastal plains in the north and hills and mountains in the interior. The government system is a
        republic; the chief of state and head of government is the president. Sri Lanka has transitioned to a
        market-orientated economy, but the central government is still involved in economic planning. Sri Lanka is a
        member of the <em>Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA)</em> and the <em>South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
        (SAARC)</em>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><i>Culture of Sri Lanka</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The culture of Sri Lanka has been influenced by many factors but has managed to retain much of its ancient
        aspects. Mostly it has been influenced by its long history and its Buddhist heritage. The country has a rich
        artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. Sri Lankan lifestyle is
        reflected in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. South Indian influences are visible in many aspects. There are
        some influences from colonisation by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British. Sri Lankan culture is best
        known abroad for its cricket, food, holistic medicine, religious icons like the <b>Buddhist flag</b>, and cultural
        exports such as tea, cinnamon and gems. Sri Lankan culture is diverse, as it varies from region to region.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><i>Languages of Sri Lanka</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p><mark>Sinhala (also called Sinhalese or Singhalese)</mark> is the mother tongue of the Sinhalese ethnic group which is the
        largest in Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages.</p>

    <p><mark>Sinhala</mark> is spoken by about <strong>16 million</strong> people in Sri Lanka, about 13 million of who are native speakers. It is
        one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, along with Tamil, which has its origins
        in South India.</p>

    <p>Most Sri Lankans can speak <mark>English</mark>, though of course, their brand of English may sound a bit strange at first.
        Some struggle with English and that is sometimes due to a lack of confidence. Just enjoy the experience, if you
        can learn a little of Sinhala. The Sinhalese will go out of their way to help you because you have gone out of
        your way to learn their language, their most cherished possession and symbol of identity.</p>

    <h1><font color="red" face="arial"><u>Pets</u></font></h1>
    <p><b>A pet, or companion animal</b>, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working
        animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances,
        intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis <big>(such as a stray animal)</big>
        and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Two of the most popular pets are <del>dogs and cats</del>. Other animals commonly kept include <font color="blue">rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents such
            as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; birds such as parrots, passerines, and fowls; reptiles
            such as turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas; aquatic pets such as fish, freshwater snails, and saltwater snails;
            amphibians such as frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets such as tarantulas and hermit crabs</font>. Small pets may be
            grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <tt><mark>Pets provide their owners, or guardians, both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the
                human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living
                alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved
                class of therapy animals that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing
                homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, or emotional
                goals with patients.</mark></tt>

<body>
    <h1><font type="arial" color="green"><i>Chemistry: The Science of Matter</i></font></h1>

    <h2>1. <sub>Chemical Elements</sub></h2>
    <p>Chemical elements are the building blocks of matter. Each element is represented by a unique symbol:</p>

    <p><sup>H</sup> Hydrogen</p>
    <p><sup>He</sup> Helium</p>
    <p><sup>O</sup> Oxygen</p>
    <p><sup>C</sup> Carbon</p>

    <h2>2. <sub>Chemical Compounds</sub></h2>
    <p>Chemical compounds are formed when elements combine in specific ratios. Some common compounds include:</p>

    <p>Water: H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>Carbon Dioxide: CO<sub>2</sub></p>
    <p>Ammonia: NH<sub>3</sub></p>
    <p>Methane: CH<sub>4</sub></p>

    <h2>3. <sub>Periodic Table</sub></h2>
    <p>The Periodic Table organizes elements by their properties. It provides valuable information about each element,
        such as atomic number and atomic mass.</p>

    <h2>4. <sub>Atomic Structure</sub></h2>

    <p>Atoms are the smallest units of matter. They consist of:</p>
    <p><sup>Protons</sup> (positively charged)</p>
    <p><sup>Neutrons</sup> (neutral)</p>
    <p><sup>Electrons</sup> (negatively charged)</p>

    <h2>5. <sub>Conclusion</sub></h2>
    <p>Chemistry is a fascinating field that helps us understand the substances that make up our world. It plays a
        crucial role in industries, medicine, and environmental science, among others.</p>

<h1><i><font type="Arial" color="red">How does open source software work?</font></i></h1>
<p><mark>Open source code</mark> is typically stored in a <b>public repository</b>, or repo, which anyone may access, contribute to, and share <big>(depending on permissions)</big>. <tt>Contributors upload new versions of the code to the project</tt>, building and improving on the existing work to deliver new features and updates. All the work is performed publicly in the repo so that anyone may add to it.

The code usually comes with a <small>license</small>, <del>which defines what a user can and cannot do with the software</del>. <font color="green">Some licenses are permissive and allow you to use and distribute the code for any purpose, while others may require that you explicitly log any changes when you share. Other licenses may stipulate that all copies of the source code be free and available for public use.</font> Some of today’s most popular licenses include:</p>

<h3><i><font type="Arial" color="grey">MIT</h3> 
<p>The MIT license carries very few restrictions on what can be done with the source code, which makes it the most permissive and widely used free license. All the license requires is that future versions of the code must include the original copyright notice and a copy of the license itself.</font></p>

<h3><i><font type="Arial" color="brown">GNU General Public License (GPL) v2</h3> 
<p>Created by the GNU Project, GPLv2 explicitly requires that source code be made available for public use. GPLv2 is also a copyleft license, which means that any version of the source code must also be released under the same license, GPLv2.</font></p>

<h3><i><font type="Arial" color="green">GNU GPLv3</h3>
<p>Like its predecessor, GPLv3 also requires future versions of the code to be released under the same license. Unlike GPLv2, GPLv3 is compatible with the popular Apache 2.0 license, specifically addresses patent rights, and does not require that source code be made available to the public.</font></p>

<h3><i><font type="Arial" color="blue">Apache 2.0</h3>
<p>Much like the MIT license, the Apache 2.0 license is a popular and permissive software license that allows users to do anything they want with the code—so long as they log any major changes made.MIT. The MIT license carries very few restrictions on what can be done with the source code, which makes it the most permissive and widely used free license.
