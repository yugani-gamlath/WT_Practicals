    <p><b>A pet, or companion animal</b>, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working
        animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances,
        intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis <big>(such as a stray animal)</big>
        and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Two of the most popular pets are <del>dogs and cats</del>. Other animals commonly kept include <font color="blue">rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents such
            as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; birds such as parrots, passerines, and fowls; reptiles
            such as turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas; aquatic pets such as fish, freshwater snails, and saltwater snails;
            amphibians such as frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets such as tarantulas and hermit crabs</font>. Small pets may be
            grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.</p>

            <tt><mark>Pets provide their owners, or guardians, both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the
                human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living
                alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved
                class of therapy animals that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing
                homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, or emotional
                goals with patients.</mark></tt>
